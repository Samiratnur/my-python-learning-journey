#Sequence Types:
str: Represents strings, which are sequences of characters (e.g., "hello", 'world').
list: Represents lists, which are ordered, mutable sequences of items.
tuple: Represents tuples, which are ordered, immutable sequences of items.
range: Represents a sequence of numbers, often used in loops.

#Binary Types:
bytes: Represents immutable sequences of bytes.
bytearray: Represents mutable sequences of bytes.
memoryview: Provides a memory view of an object.

#Mapping Type:
dict: Represents dictionaries, which store key-value pairs.

#Boolean Type:
bool: Represents boolean values, either True or False.

#Set Types:
