- `basics/` – Simple Python programs (variables, loops, conditions, etc.)
- `functions/` – Function-based practice problems
- `lists_and_dicts/` – Practice with lists, dictionaries, and data structures
- `file_handling/` – File input/output examples
- `projects/` – Mini projects or problem-solving tasks

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 3
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- Git & GitHub

## 🌱 Learning Focus

- Strengthening Python fundamentals
- Writing clean, readable code
- Practicing problem-solving techniques
- Organizing code in folders and files

## 📌 Notes

This is an ongoing practice repository. I regularly add new files as I progress in my Python and Azure Data Engineering journey.
